    Daily norm of sports

  <span class="news-text">
    The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout
    the week for adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we adjust that number to 110 minutes every day? While it might
    seem like a high number to hit, dedicating 110 minutes daily to sporting activities may offer unparalleled benefits to
    physical health, mental well-being, and overall quality of life.
